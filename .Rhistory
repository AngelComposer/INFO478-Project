## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
summary(cars)
## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
plot(pressure)
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
