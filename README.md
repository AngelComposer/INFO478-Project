# Project Description

**What is the purpose of your research project?**.
The purpose of this research project is to analyze the correlating factors relating to heart attacks.

**What other research has been done in this area? (include 3+ links to related works, as well as a summary of what that work has discovered.)**
[Race, Ethnicity, Hypertension, and Heart Disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109721053821?via%3Dihub)
* Hypertension control remains a persistent problem for public health
* This study revealed higher prevalence of hypertension control among specific groups of racial or ethnic minority groups, especially African American adults
* Social detriments should be considered in public health clinical research
* With this study, we can better understand the impacts social detriments can have on health and cardiovascular disease and strokes

[The cardiovascular health study: Design and rationale](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/104727979190005W?via%3Dihub)
* Longitudinal study of heart disease and stroke in adults 65 years or older
* Purpose is to identify factors for onset and course of disease
* Main findings: mortality rates are declining but prevalence, incidence, and cost of disease is increeasing
* With this study, we can better understand the biggest factors that lead to cardiovascular disease

[Increasing Cardiac Rehabilitation Participation From 20% to 70%: A Road Map From the Million Hearts Cardiac Rehabilitation Collaborative](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/jmcp/news2.pdf)
* This study focuses on intervention methods
* If cardiac rehabilitation can increase, quality of life can be improved
* With the practice of cardiac rehabilitation, educational awareness, and promotion of lifestyle counseling and exercise, we see its association with decreased mortality, cardiac mortality, and rehospitalizations. However, only 20-30% of individuals participate in cardiac rehabilitation within the US.

**What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be. You must find at least two data sources at this stage.**     
The data we will be using will be from the CDC website that we found.  
[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) - National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey-nhanes-national-cardiovascular-disease-su-00a88)
* Variables in this dataset that could be useful:
  + Race
  + Age
  + Indicator (poor diet, smoking)
  + Category (risk factor, cardiovascular disease)

[Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
* Variables in this dataset that could be useful:
  + Age
  + Sex
  + Chest pain type (encoded by 4 numerical values)
  + Resting blood pressure
  + Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
  + Maximum heart rate

**Who is your target audience?**  
Our target audience is the US adult population, as we hope to spread awareness about cardiovascular diseases, mortality rates, and correlating factors.

**What should your audience learn from your resource?**  
Our audience should learn to answer the following questions: What factors correlate with decreased cardiovascular health? What factors correlate to increased mortality from cardiovascular events?
Furthermore, our audience should learn about population statistics regarding cardiovasvular risk groups and resources for further learning.

# Technical Description

**What will be the format of your final product?**  
The format of the final product will be a comprehensive report in the form of a compiled .rmd file.

**Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?**  
We anticipate potential challenges in collecting information, as data management and data cleaning can be difficult when working with large population-scale datasets.

**What new technical skills will you need to learn in order to complete your project?**  
We will need to learn how to create appealing graphics and visualizations to best showcase our findings.

**What major challenges do you anticipate?**  
We anticipate challenges regarding cleaning the data and wrangling it into something usable and digestable to our audience.
